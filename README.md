# Object_tracker
This is a project that utilises a lot of 3D printed parts(All are designed in Fusion 360), an old phone, ESP and a lot of other components, to run a custom app, that tracks objects. It's controlled from an website. The project isnt perfect, and there are many places for it to be imporved.
