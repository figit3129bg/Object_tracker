# Object_tracker
This is a project that utilises a lot of 3D printed parts(All are designed in Fusion 360), an old phone, ESP and a lot of other components, to run a custom app, that tracks objects. It's controlled from an website. The project isnt perfect, and there are many places for it to be imporved.

The main plan of the project is:
-Creating the 3D models of the components  - Completed soon to be uploaded
-Full assembly and fitment/tolerance tests - Completed soon to be uploaded
-Testing all electronics(stepper motors and limit switches) on breadboard with main controller(ESP 32 s3) and seeing if they behave as expected - 50% completed
-Making more permanent prototype soldering boards - Completed soon to be uploaded
-Full wiring and electronics checks - Uncomplete
-Making final verison of the code   - Uncomplete
